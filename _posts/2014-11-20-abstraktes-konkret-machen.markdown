## How to visualize abstract concepts?<a name="short"></a>

- Metonymy: Use attribute, related thing to represent a concept.
- Pars pro toto: Use a part to represent the entire concept.
- Symbol: Use something to represent something else. On the merits of convention.
- Simile: compare one thing with another thing of a differnent kind, making a description more emphatic or vivid.
- Conceptual Metaphors: Up is better. Low is bad. Perspective is threatening.
- Context: Show similar thing/structure in a conctext it does not belong in.
- Contradiction: Contradict what is known to be real.
- Example: Don't try showing the concept, show an instantiation of it.
- Synasthesia: produce a sense impression relating to one sense or part of the body by simulation of another sense or part of the body.
- Exaggeration: represent something better or worse, bigger or smaller than it really is.
- Hyponym: Use an instance of a category instead of the category itself: "spoon" instead of "cutlery".
- Humanize: Portray a concept as if it were a living human being.
- Paradoxon: Show a concept in a way that fundamentally contradicts itself.
- Irony: signify the opposite of what you really mean. Show concept in a way that contradicts expectation.
