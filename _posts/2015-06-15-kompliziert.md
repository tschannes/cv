3 einfache Gründe, warum kompliziert überzeugt
Kompliziert ist einfach besser

## Notes on The Guru Effect by Dan Sperber

> the contrast I want to draw between “reflective” and “intuitive beliefs” is not between beliefs held because of a cause and beliefs held because of a reason, but between beliefs held with or without mentally represented reasons.

> Quite generally, sentences vastly underdetermine their interpretation.

> Utterances raise expectations of relevance that guide the comprehension process towards an interpretation that satisfies these expectations.

Confirmation bias prevents us from being aware of alternatives.

> We expect what people tell us to be relevant, and we interpret it in a way that confirms this expectation. 

> Of course, speakers or writers tend to overestimate the relevance of what they have to say, and hearers’ or readers’ expectations of relevance are frequently disappointed.

Whether or not we listen to an account crucially depends on how much authority we think someone has.

> Departing from plain and easy formulation is often a way of signalling that something other than plain meaning is intended.

If someone talks in a convoluted and complicated way, this may indicate that:

> if the speaker of writer chose to go ahead and express a thought hard for her audience to understand, she is thereby suggesting that the thought in question is relevant enough to be worth the effort.

> Given that, for the faithful, the relevance of the belief is beyond question, its very mysteriousness is a strong indication of its significance. Impenetrability indicates profundity.

Working assumption: 

> the content of mysteries would be extraordinarily relevant to them if only they could grasp it. 

> difficulty is presented as pertaining not to expression but to content itself, as being not a rhetorical device but a direct and unavoidable aspect of sophisticated thinking.

When you are not supposed to understand:

> readers may take their very opacity as evidence of their depth

> With a prior high confidence in the intellectual worth of the author, negative judgment is almost ruled out and depth can be inferred, even if no satisfactory interpretation of the statement in question is ever arrived at.

> Authority and argumentation seem to be two quite different paths to persuasion

Whether or not someone can follow your argument may be secondary:

> To argue is to make an effort in order to appeal to one’s audience’s reason.

> the very fact that I made the effort and took the risk involved in arguing may contribute to the believability of my conclusion, even if the argument remains unexamined.

> how could my failure to fully understand a statement or an argument ever justify me in granting even more authority to its source? 

Obscurity may reflect the limitations of the reader? Obscurity interpreted can lead to a cult-like following.

> Clear statements and easy arguments may become the objects of a collective evaluation, but only obscure statements and difficult arguments are likely to become the objects of a collective endeavour of interpretation.

Interpreting obscure statements or texts yields social benefits like "that of belongingn, of getting recognition as a person in the know, capable of apprecaiting the importance of a difficult great thinker."

> obscurity of respected masters is not just a sign of the depth of their thinking, but a proof of their genius.

> an interpretation "may be just as obscure as the thought it is meant to interpret."

> Why "obscure texts and their authors come to be overestimated because of their very obscurity."
