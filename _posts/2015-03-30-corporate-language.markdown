excerpt: "Anders als Corporate Design, welches das visuelle Auftreten einer Marke regelt, kommt Corporate Language, also die sprachliche Brand-Charakteristik, oft zu kurz. Ein Kriterienraster hilft Marken sprachlich auf die Spr√ºnge."

Theory of voice and literary character lent from literary theory: Narrative Fiction by Shlomith Rimmon-Kennan.

Why is it that brands have copious amounts of documents on corporate branding, but seldom dedicate similar efforts to defining how they speak?

The answer is easy. Visual branding is immediate, flashy, fast to communicate and replicate. Spoken branding on the other hand is quite the opposite. Its effects are sublte, not immediate but longer lasting, and it is not reproducible without a concerted effort of the editorial team.

Defining features of voice:

- Who is the narrator?
- Serious? How serious (reliable) is the narrator?
- Stiff? How formal is the narrator?
- What about burocracy? Check sentence length, word length, Number of commas...
- Medium (formal letter, email, Twitter, website...)
