# Notes: Content Everywhere by Sara Wachter-Boettcher

> Letting Go of the Words: Writing Web Content That Works.

## So what's wrong with content?

> You want content that's ready for what the future holds, it's time to stop making more content, and instead start building systems that allow you to do more.

> Luke Woblewski writes in his book Mobile First, 'Even if you can create native apps for each platform, the cost of maintaining them can quickly make it prohibitive.

> The more you strive for the perfect page, the more you limit yourself to just that page.

> A Website is inherently uncontrollable, and trying to reign it in--to give it the fixed Precision that a Printer page or physical canvas affords us--is an inherently losing battle.

## Solutions?

> You need to create content in **chunks**, giving it the fluidity and flexibility for it to travel--across devices, sites, and channels--so users can experience it in whatever context they choose.

> **Content Strategy**: a discipline dedicated to reducing the pain of deealing with content that's gone wrong and determining viable plans for making it go right--for both users and organizations.

> We need **Interfaces that will help guide content creators** on how to write and structure their content for reuse.

> As your content travels, unfixed from a single site, you must learn to let it go.

> The challenge of making content more flexible begins with the name: content.

## Talking Content Terminology
- Content Type: the actual thing a user would read or use. In terms of database: Entities: Units of data that can be classified into types.
- Content Element: the Modell and chunks that make up that content type. Are a) distinct from one another. Represent b) a unit of information. Attributes in database-parlance: Essentially, all the chunks that make the content whole.
- Content Model: the connective tissue between all of them. In terms of databases: Relationships: These show how different entities relate to one another (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many).
- Identifiers: Your entities' unique IDs.

## Questions to start modularizing content
- Which of your content Goals does this type of content support? How?
- Why would a user want this content?
- What do you want users to do once they've consumed this content?

> A taxonomy is a classification system.

> Metadata is the new art direction. Ethan Resnick.

> Again, Starbucks' rule is to bump the sidebar to the bottom--and this time, it might be affecting their sales.

> When you **interdigitate content**, key elements, like calls to action, can retain their emphasis at any display size.

> Getting Responsive isn't just a design-and-dev Problem. It's a content problem.

> This approach was only possible when NPR stopped labeling ist content chunks by their location on the page--such as 'sidebar'--and started labeling them in a more semantic way, calling them names like 'timeline' or 'quick facts'.

> Markup related to Appearance "is a lot like Make-up. While my olive-skinned friend looks fantastic in scarlet lipstick, that same schade gives my face a particularly ghastly pallor."

> Semantic Markup, on the other hand, is designed to reveal, in a machine-readable way, the intrinsic meaning in your content.

> When she writes in markdown, everything she does ends up completely Semantic, without it being a burden to write.

> When the people who know the content best are included in talks about how that content will be structured, stored, and Transported, things just work better.

> Getting content everywhere you want still comes back to the people creating and entering it in the first place, and their ability to stop thinking about fixed pages and start thinking about building more flexible content systems.

## SEO?

> It's near impossible to know where you 'rank' on the search engine results page for any given term.

> Keywords: In reality they're simply the words your audience naturell uses when looking for your product, service, or information.

> Content Hubs: not only can these Sorte of hubs help users find things in the way they want, [...] but they can also help you rain mir Traktion with search engines.

> The first rule of SEO is always to make great content that Pople want to visit and link to. Mike Atherton.

> Site search data is powerful stuff: it tells you, in users' own words, what they want from your site and whether or not you have it.


## Layer Content instead of cutting content on mobile

> Of course, in order to layer content, that content needs to be structured--written and stored in such a way that parts can be Exposee and parts hidden.

> It's nearly impossible to say what a user will or wohnt want to do from her mobile device.

> While lazy-loading content or removing some images may sometimes make sense for small screens, this approach to solging the road time problem also begas another question: Should that content be there in the first place?

> What I do advocate is that organizations use mobile as a lese to help them improve all their content. Here's a chance to edit your content to be more concise and written more clearly (that's not 'writing for mobile,' however--that's just good writing). Karen McGrane

> Stephen Hat has long argued that content should be platform-agnostic--that is, everyone can access all the same content, no matter what. However, the experience itself should be platform-aware, where the device's unique capabilities are taken into account, and enhanced features are included to support them.

> Many organizations that untertake a project like this find that it's actually most difficult to help the people involved change how they operate: They need to invest in ongoing training and guidance.

> Fact is, you have to make choices what's important enough to invest your limited time and budget on, and what isn't.

## Content Shifting is...

> Content Shifting is the process of taking content from one context--as in, a specific website or application--and shifting it to another location.

> Content Shifting makes it easier for new Audienzen to discover your content.

> They're not taking content away from you; they're taking a piece of you along with them. And that's a powerful thing.

> The old pay-per-eyeball thing isn't working.

### Three reasons why people shift content

1. People want personal collections of information instead of all the information.
2. People want to tame the flood of information they are exposed to every day. 
3. People don't tolerate terrible reading experiences.

### How to deal with content shifting

1. First, you must accept that your content will be shifted and moved.
2. Second, you need to Inzest in content that's worth remembering.

> Great content is memorable, and being memorable is about more than your URL. It's about your voice, your message, and your ability to help others.

> If your organization is obsessed with broadcasting ist message--rather than allowing customers to deine their own experiences--then you're only going to get more uncomfortable as the future Unholds.

## How Organisation-centric thinking Harms Organizations

> Shifting for mobile is great. But it's only enough to get by **right now**.

> Publish content in the name of the people, not the name of the agency that happens to produce it.

You'll need:

1. Clear Vision
2. Customer Focus
3. Collaboration

> How do you know when vision is laccking? Once you start looking, it's actually pretty easy to spot: emphasis on the 'bottom line' rather than on product or service quality, endlessly Kasino after new clients or markets, deparmental infighting over budgets and priorities, and disagreement over who your audience is--or the deviier to have 'everyone' as a customer.

> Lack of customer centricity telltales? One big one is if Folks ansiehst on asking new customers for exzessive personal data because the 'organization needs it'.

## Ways forward

- Create a 'Digital Services Innovation Center'
- 'Be a role model and a resource for creating a foundation for adaptable, flexible content. It's to nable others to experiment--and get them excited about the possibilities.
