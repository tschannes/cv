## Making Media Production Agile

## User Story

> As a [PERSONA], I want to [DO STH], so that I can [DERIVE A REWARD].

> Good Design comes from Focus. Focus comes from understanding (your user).

## User Persona

- Think
- Feel
- See
- Do

## Problem Scenarios

- Choose the right level of abstraction (Problems persist, whereas solutions are temporary)
- Find alternatives (find workarounds)
- Identify your value proposition (where are we adding value, where our competition does not)

### Evaluate Problem Scenarios (flight level)

1. Why is Problem Scenario X important?
2. What is the Parent Problem Scenario for X? What can I learn from Parent Scenario?
3. Create Child Problem Scenarios. 

## User Journey Fail

1. Do literally what the customers want
2. Do what we think the customers want

## Use Hypotheses

- For Personas (ask directly)
- For Problem Scenarios (ask directly)
- Derive: Value Hypothesis (do not ask this directly, due to bias below)
- Customer Creation Hypothesis (pricing, value comms, to motivate customer)
- Usability Hypothesis (design, structure, placement to motivate customer)

Why User Research fails? Confirmation Bias and Social Pressure. People do not want to argue or disagree. So whatever you propose will be agreed upon. E.G. Yellow Walkman.

## Tools

- Interviews: Start with general questions, continue with more and more specific questions. Answers do not have to be representative. Our job is to take the specifics and try and generalize.
