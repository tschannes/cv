## How is writing for the web different from any other type of writing? How is it different from copy testend for a Broschüre?

- it can be measured. How is this a good thing? How is it bad?
- it has to be short and digestible: Kind of like copy for the Radio (Research writing for the Radio)
- it has to be more structured.
- it (the change of words) can (has to) be Researched.

### It can be measured!

- Comparative searching
- Search suggestions
- Analytics
- Adwords
- Competitors that are ranking higher

### It needs to be brief!
- the why: Scanning the web.
- the how: Put first things first. Keep it simple, stupid! Step back from your (more often than not home made) complexity.
- Cut the crap.


### It requires more structure!
- Use titles
- Use types, that people recognize from elsewhere: Date, author, Link, caption.
- Use rhythm. How to obtain it? Media...

### Choice of words relies on research!
Up until now, whether you wrote "Studium" or "Ausbildung" relied on assumptions.
Now you choose the words and expressions that are most likely to be searched for. 

## How is it the same?

- it needs to offer readers something. People need to be able to learn something based on your content. 
- When you teach, teach in a way that is entertaining. Turn your content into a game. Or a story (minimally with Monsters, Champions and glorious Reeds).
- it needs to be a first class citizen. Just like printed materials. And yes even with the possibility to just change that   spelling mistake. 
- it needs to be quality controlled. Sound research.
