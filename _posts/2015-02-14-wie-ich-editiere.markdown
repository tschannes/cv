# My 5 steps of copy editing

- Cleanse Input. Identify passives, marketese, nominalese. Check grammar.
- Dig up the Gold
- Unearth Structure. Group ideas. Make it skimmable.

- Connect the available dots. Clarify the heck out of stuff
- Let people explain it to you in their own words.
- Look at it from the outside
- Ask why a lot. Don't be afraid to be a pain in the ass

- Embrace criticism
- Throw around alternatives
- Re-Research (if your source does not help)

- Read it out loud.
- Keep it personal. Maintain Tone of Voice.

- Wait. Before. You. Publish.
